                        <p>You're probably wary of yet another system promising the moon with this or that new app. There are far too many feel-good, wishy-washy systems cooked up by people looking to make a quick buck.</p>
                        <p>Here's what makes Building a Second Brain different: It's built on timeless and unchanging principles.</p>
                        <p>You see, while technology and trends are constantly changing, the heart of the creative process remains fundamentally the same:</p>
                        <p>‚Ä¢ Capturing information from the outside world<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ Organizing it in a way that lets you easily find and use it<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ Distilling it down to the best ideas<br>
                        ‚Ä¢ And then expressing your ideas in your unique voice through writing, speaking, designing, or teaching</p>
                        <p>This is the C.O.D.E System, our 4-step process for consistently turning the information you consume into creative output and concrete results. And it works in any app or platform you prefer to use.</p>
